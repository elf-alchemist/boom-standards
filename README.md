# Boom Standards

This project is a series of feature set specifications for the Boom/MBF lineage of Doom source ports.
The basic premise is to clarify and document the historical, under-specified, or non-documented features that were introduced in the more than 20 years of history that spans the Boom/MBF source port lineage, taking pre-existing documentation and modern source port behavior to clearly outline what specific functionality a port can, can't, should or shouldn't have.

## Goals

This project aims for achieving the following formal goals:
1. Serve as a hub of documentation for source port developer trying to implement new and old features associated with the Boom/MBF lineage in their ports.
2. Serve as a hub of discussion for developers and modders to discuss the necessity, viability and standardization of new features.
3. Serve as "single source of truth" for all future feature set standard documentation.
4. Improve upon older documentation by way of:  
  4.1 Adding important details that were missing in the original documents, reducing undefined behavior as much as possible.  
  4.2 Modifying outdated documentation to reflect how modern source ports apply the given feature sets.  
  4.3 Create new documentation for features which previously did not have their own formal specifications.
