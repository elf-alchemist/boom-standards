# Boom Standards
This project is a series of feature set spefications for Boom-derived Doom source ports.
The main objective is clarify and document the historical, under-specified, or non-documented features that were introduced in the more than 20 years of history that spans the Boom source port lineage, taking pre-existing documentation and modern source port behavior to clearly outline what specific functionality a port can, can't, should or shouldn't have.
